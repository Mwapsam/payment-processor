the architecture of a payment gateway project using MTN Mobile Money API, Rails, and React:

1. Front-end (React): The front-end is responsible for displaying the user interface (UI) to the user and communicating with the back-end. In this project, the React application will be used to build the user interface, provide a seamless user experience, and send requests to the Rails server.

2. Back-end (Rails): The back-end is responsible for handling user requests, processing transactions, and communicating with the MTN Mobile Money API. In this project, the Rails server will receive requests from the React application, process transactions, communicate with the MTN Mobile Money API, and return responses to the front-end.

3. MTN Mobile Money API: The MTN Mobile Money API is a third-party payment gateway service that will be used to process transactions. The API will handle payment requests and responses between the user and the payment gateway.

4. Database: The database will be used to store transaction data, user information, and payment records. In this project, PostgreSQL will be used as the primary database.

5. Authentication and Authorization: To ensure secure access to the payment gateway, authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented. Devise will be used for user authentication and authorization.

6. Payment gateway integration: The payment gateway integration will be handled using the MTN Mobile Money API. The API will be integrated with the back-end to facilitate payment processing.

7. Application Deployment: The application will be deployed using a cloud-based platform like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Here's an example of how you could design a database schema for this project using PostgreSQL:

1. Users table:
 - id (primary key)
 - name
 - email
 - phone_number
 - password_digest
 - account_balance
2. Transactions table:
 - id (primary key)
 - user_id (foreign key)
 - payment_method_id (foreign key)
 - transaction_status
 - transaction_amount
 - transaction_id
 - transaction_timestamp
3. Payment methods table:
 - id (primary key)
 - payment_method_type
 - payment_method_name
 - fee_structure
4. Fees table:
 - id (primary key)
 - payment_method_id (foreign key)
 - transaction_amount
 - fee_percentage
